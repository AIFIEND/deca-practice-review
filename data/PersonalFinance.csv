Credit card companies using the adjusted balance method charge interest only on the principal balance that remains each month. To calculate how much total interest Deacon will pay during the initial three billing periods, first calculate the monthly interest rate by dividing the APR by the number of months in a year (0.20 / 12 = .0167). Then, multiply the monthly interest rate by the principal amount to determine the amount of interest charged for the first month (0.0167 X $600 = $10.00). For the following month, you first need to determine the new principal amount. Subtract the interest amount charged during the initial month from last month's repayment to determine the payment amount applied to the principal ($200 - $10 = $190). Next, subtract the payment amount applied to the principal amount at the end of the first month from the original balance to determine the new principal amount to be charged interest for the second month ($600 - $190 = $410). Repeat these steps for any subsequent months (Month 2: 0.0167 X $410 = $6.83; $200 - $6.83 = $193.17; $410 - $193.17 = $216.83; Month 3: 0.0167 X $216.83 = $3.61).

If you are 30 to 60 days late on your loan payment, your account is considered delinquent and your lender will likely report the missed payment to credit bureaus. If you go more than 90 days without making a payment on your loan, your account transitions from delinquency to default status (failing to repay the loan according to the loan agreement terms).

You should change passwords periodically for online or mobile banking to ensure security. You should always log out completely when finished with a banking session. Although some mobile or online banking services automatically log out once you close the app or web page, you should always take initiative to hit the log out button, just in case. 2022, from https://www.monroefederal.com/online-and-mobile-banking-safeguards/",Financial Analysis,7,easy

Which of the following forms of payment could result in a total cost to Louis of more than $400:,Credit card,Debit card,Personal check,Cash,A,"Credit card.

This is how paying with a credit card can end up costing more than the amount of the purchase.

So, Theodore paid $150 on top of his principal. The interest plus the principal is $1,150 ($150 + $1,000 = $1,150), the total cost of the loan.

When using the exact interest method, time is equal to the term of the loan expressed as days divided by the number of days in a year, which is 365. So, in this case, first convert the term of the loan from weeks to days by multiplying by the number of days in a week (36 X 7 = 252 days). Then, calculate the factor Time by dividing the number of days of the loan by the number of days in a year (252 / 365 = 0.6904109). Next, multiply the principal amount of the loan by the interest rate and the time to determine the amount of interest on the loan ($7,500 X 10.875% X 0.6904109 = $563.11638).

Because financial planners are compensated in different ways, it is important to consider the fee structure when selecting a financial-services provider. Some financial planners charge a flat fee, while others base their fees on the number and size of transactions. Some financial planners charge for research and consulting time. Therefore, it is important to ask financial planners about their fee structures, so investors can determine if they can afford the fees. A financial planner may provide references for a potential client, but the potential client does not generally need to provide the financial planner with references. It is inappropriate to ask the financial planner about their personal income.

The disadvantage to paying just the minimum amount due on your credit card each month is that you,pay interest on purchases.,establish a credit rating.,defer cash payments.,earn quarterly dividends.,A,"Pay interest on purchases. Credit is the arrangement by which individuals or businesses can purchase now and pay later. Many types of businesses (e.g., banks, large retailers) offer credit cards to consumers and businesses to purchase goods and services. Usually, the credit card issuer sends the credit card holder a monthly statement. The information on the statement includes a list of the purchases made during the billing cycle and the amount owed for the purchases, which includes the interest charges. If the credit card holder pays the minimum amount due, the amount of interest owed accumulates on the balance due until the debt is paid off. Because interest rates can be high, this can be a disadvantage to the credit card holder. It is important to establish a good credit rating in order to borrow money in the future from other lenders. Therefore, establishing a credit rating is not necessarily a disadvantage. Credit card holders do not earn quarterly dividends on their credit cards.

"As Tom uses his credit card to make purchases in a responsible manner, he should remember that credit is a(n)",privilege.,loan.,asset.,tax.,B,"Loan. A loan is a sum of money lent to a person or business for a specific time period that is repayable with interest. Credit is the arrangement by which a person purchases now and pays later. A lending institution issues credit cards, which allow people to purchase now and pay later. The lender provides credit card users with a limit within which they can charge purchases. The lender pays for the purchases and then sends the credit card user a bill/statement each month that indicates the monthly minimum payment and interest charges due to the lender. It is important for people to pay credit card balances responsibly so they do not accumulate so much debt that they cannot afford to pay the lender. Using credit for purchases helps a person build a personal credit history, which lenders consider when a person applies for a large loan to purchase a car or a house. An asset is something of value that a person owns. Credit is not an asset or a tax.

Identity theft occurs when an individual obtains and uses another person's information (e.g., credit cards) without that person's consent. To reduce the risk of identity theft, people should use secure web browsers to make purchases. Because internet sales transactions often require a person to provide credit card information, it is important to make sure that the web browsers are secure. Using secure websites reduces the risk of computer hackers obtaining confidential information for fraudulent purposes. Another way to reduce the risk of identity theft is to memorize passwords. If a personal planner is stolen, the risk of identity theft goes up because the passwords are written down. Also, people should not share bank account numbers with others.

The disadvantage to paying just the minimum amount due on your credit card each month is that you,defer cash payments.,establish a credit rating.,earn quarterly dividends.,pay interest on purchases.,D,"Pay interest on purchases. Credit is the arrangement by which individuals or businesses can purchase now and pay later. Many types of businesses (e.g., banks, large retailers) offer credit cards to consumers and businesses to purchase goods and services. Usually, the credit card issuer sends the credit card holder a monthly statement. The information on the statement includes a list of the purchases made during the billing cycle and the amount owed for the purchases, which includes the interest charges. If the credit card holder pays the minimum amount due, the amount of interest owed accumulates on the balance due until the debt is paid off. Because interest rates can be high, this can be a disadvantage to the credit card holder. It is important to establish a good credit rating in order to borrow money in the future from other lenders.

A loan is a sum of money lent to a person or business for a specific time period that is repayable with interest. Credit is the arrangement by which a person purchases now and pays later. A lending institution issues credit cards, which allow people to purchase now and pay later. The lender provides credit card users with a limit within which they can charge purchases.

It is important for people to pay credit card balances responsibly so they do not accumulate so much debt that they cannot afford to pay the lender. Using credit for purchases helps a person build a personal credit history, which lenders consider when a person applies for a large loan to purchase a car or a house.

Entrepreneurs who do not keep up with trends, technology, and development opportunities in their industry run the risk of falling behind their competitors. As a result, the competitors who keep up with the latest developments might be able to provide goods and services that others are unable to provide because of the lack of training and/or knowledge. Employee performance does impact the success of a business; however, employee references do not necessarily determine the ability and attitude of a staff member in relation to job performance. There are many resources available from which business owners can obtain information and professional development. Much of this information can be found on the Internet. Requiring employees to take aptitude tests does not contribute to business failure. To determine if an individual is qualified to perform a job, the employer must know the employee's abilities. For example, a person who wants to be an administrative assistant might need to type proficiently on a keyboard. Therefore, the employer might administer a typing test to determine the speed and accuracy of the individual's typing abilities. PERSONAL FINANCIAL LITERACY EXAMâ€”KEY 15",,7,easy
