Vertical conflict occurs between channel members at different levels within the same distribution channel. A retailer that develops and markets a private line of products (e.g., CVS over-the-counter medications) is selling products that compete with the national brands it carries (e.g., Tylenol, Zyrtec, and Advil). Most often, the private brand is less expensive than national brands because the retailer does not spend as much money for packaging and advertising as the national brands do. This can cause conflict with the national brand manufacturers because the private brand has the potential to take some of their market share. A retailer that offers a popular item at an extremely low price to attract customers is using a loss-leader technique, which may cause horizontal conflict.

Marketing-information management is a marketing function that involves gathering, accessing, synthesizing, evaluating, and disseminating information to aid in business decisions. Knowledge management is the process of creating, identifying, collecting, organizing, sharing, and using knowledge and knowledge sources for the benefit of the organization or business.

How can researchers maintain respondents' attention and focus in a survey?,Make all questions positive,Group related questions together,Vary question and answer type throughout the survey,Follow a logical question order,C,"Vary question and answer type throughout the survey. When a survey includes a series of similar questions that all have the same answer choices, participants may begin to answer them in the same way out of habit. This can result in less accurate answers. If the question and answer types are varied throughout, this type of inaccuracy is less likely to occur. While following a logical question order is a characteristic of a good survey, it does not necessarily do anything to maintain respondents' focus. Making all questions positive and grouping related questions together could reduce respondents' focus rather than maintaining it. https://www.pewresearch.org/writing-survey-questions 2",Information Management,10,medium

The TUV Company wants to conduct marketing research by surveying a sample of its vast customer base. What should companies use to reduce the possibility of bias?,Phone interviews,Personal interviews,Random sampling,Referral sampling,C,"Random sampling. Because it isn't feasible to survey a large target market, researchers often survey a representative group or sample of the target market. Random sampling exists when each member of the sample group has an equal chance or the same opportunity to be selected to participate in the survey. An advantage to random sampling is that the data are less likely to be biased or skewed. Researchers might use interviews (e.g., personal, phone) when they want to obtain more in-depth information. The disadvantage to using the interview method is that there is a higher risk of interviewer bias. Referral sampling is commonly called snowball sampling.

This is an example of a(n) __________ warranty.,full,limited,implied,understood,B,"Limited. A warranty is a promise made by the seller to the customer that the seller will repair or replace a product that does not perform as expected. There are several types of warranties, including limited, full, implied, and express. Full and limited warranties are two classifications of warranties based on the extent of the promises they make. Some products carry a full warranty. A full warranty states that if the product does not work properly, is defective, or does not live up to the warranty, it must be made good within a reasonable time. The company providing the warranty may not put time limits on any implied warranties the product may have. If the problem cannot be corrected in a reasonable time, the customer does not have to wait longer but may choose a refund or a replacement. The customer need only notify the warrantor to obtain repairs. A limited warranty is one that does not have all of the provisions of a full warranty. Instead of covering the entire product, it may cover specific parts, certain repairs, or a particular time period. An implied warranty is not written or stated orally. It is simply understood by both the seller and the customer that the product will perform as expected. An express warranty is a promise expressed in a specific statement concerning the quality of the product. It may be a written statement that is given to customers. â€œUnderstoodâ€ means the same thing as â€œimplied,â€ but is not generally a word used to describe a warranty.",Product Management,8,hard

Attentive salespeople recognize product opportunities when their customers provide feedback about the business's products. For example, if several customers want something that the business doesn't have, the salesperson might be able to convince the business to produce or provide the product for these customers. By offering a new product that many customers want, the business can increase its sales and profits. Salespeople do not establish trends. Listening to customers' feedback does not always encourage a salesperson to reorganize his/her personal priorities. The purchasing department usually orders inventory for the business.

For example, a channel leader that yields a lot of power in the distribution chain may set unrealistic sales goals for a dealer, or it may pressure a supplier to lower its prices to a point that it hurts the supplier's profits. Coercion tends to create channel conflict, leads to unfair and unsatisfactory business relationships, and often disrupts the distribution process.

Strong leaders have the authority and power to influence others and direct the actions of others. A channel of distribution that has strong leadership is often able to avoid conflict within the channel because the leader has the authority to set goals for the entire channel and demand cooperation, which reduces the possibility of conflict. The leader's authority makes it possible for the leader to assign specific responsibilities to each channel member and persuade members to accomplish their individual tasks. When each member is cooperating and working for the good of the channel, there is less chance of conflict. It is not necessary for the leader to develop friendships.

A slotting allowance is a cash premium paid to a retailer to cover the costs of displaying a manufacturer's products on its shelves.
