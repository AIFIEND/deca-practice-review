Customer profiling is the process of identifying a business's most likely or ideal customer through the use of demographic, psychographic, attitudinal, and behavioral information. If a business implements an effective customer profiling system, it leads to better customer service.

Instead of increasing the price of a campaign, it will lower it. The more specific the customer, the less money a business will spend. Rather than making the customer base broader, customer profiling focuses on identifying the specific buyers that'll actually buy a product, which is more valuable than targeting everyone.

It is important for startup businesses to understand the advantages and disadvantages that come with bringing on a new employee.

An advantage of direct marketing is that it,causes consumer overload.,avoids personal interaction.,is cost-effective.,must follow legal regulations.,C,"Is cost-effective. Direct marketing is a form of advertising that seeks a specific, measurable action from a targeted group of consumers, using direct mail (such as catalogs or postcards), telemarketing, emails, etc., that are sent directly to a consumerâ€™s home or business. Direct marketing is often cost-effective for marketers because they do not need to pay a retailer a percentage of their sales, thus allowing them to retain more of their profits. Consumer overload is a disadvantage of direct marketing, as the general consumer is already in marketing overload with several companies trying to contact them (through mail, email, social media, etc.) and earn their business. Personal interaction is an advantage of direct marketing rather than a disadvantage. When working directly with customers, marketers can control the interaction and determine how to meet customers' needs more effectively. Following legal regulations is a disadvantage of direct marketing. Rules and regulations are always changing, and failure to adhere to them can result in penalties and fines owed to federal agencies or customers.

A business owner considers many factors when determining if s/he should hire an employee. An important consideration is the nature of the work that the owner needs to have done. For example, if the owner needs someone to pay bills and mail invoices, s/he would likely hire a person who has bookkeeping skills. The owner must also consider if s/he can afford to pay a fulltime or a part-time employee. Hiring a full-time employee is more costly because the person works longer hours, which increases payroll expenses. Benefits are usually not offered to part-time employees, which makes part-time employees less costly to the business. Training needs are important but depend on the skills the owner needs for the business. Property taxes, the screening process, and attitude are not factors that small-business owners consider when deciding to hire additional employees.

There are many ways to harvest a venture, including closing the business entirely, selling the business to another person or company, keeping the business intact and releasing cash flows, and taking the company ""public"" through an IPO (initial public offering). IPO means that the entrepreneur is selling stock to the public and giving up control of some or all of the business; over time, the venture becomes a public corporation.

To build and maintain customer relationships, a company's brand promise should strive to create positive experiences for customersâ€”experiences that will encourage them to return to the business again and again. Companies use various touchpoints to create these experiences for their customers. Touchpoints are all of the opportunities that a company has to connect with its customers and reinforce its brand value.

Businesses often use slogans and trade characters as elements of their brands. Changing slogans frequently or developing different trade characters may confuse customers, which may reduce brand recognition.

Which of the following methods of financial analysis displays all information as percentages and is particularly useful for comparing companies within their industries:,Common-sized statements,Vertical analysis,Horizontal analysis,Trend analysis,A,"Common-sized statements. Common-sized statements use percentages for the purposes of comparing one company to another within an industry or one company to overall industry averages. Percentages are used for comparison purposes because the relative sizes of companies can make it difficult to use dollar figures, for example. Horizontal analysis is also used for comparison, but it is most often used to compare the same pieces of information as they have changed from one period to another within a single company. Percentages are also often used in vertical analysis, but they are used to show what percentage of a general category is made up of a single item (e.g., what percentage of total assets are long-term assets). These percentages can then be compared across time but are not as often used to compare businesses to one another. Trend analysis is a method that uses data from the past to predict future data. This is often used in analyzing stock prices. [Lesson 14-2]. Boston, MA: Cengage Learning, Inc.",Financial Analysis,4,hard

This indicates that a need might exist for higher and lower quality products in various price ranges. Armed with this information, a new business has a better chance to provide products that customers want and need and to compete successfully in a specific market. Before locating in a community, a new business would consider the size and availability of space, and the cost of supplies and equipment.

To determine the amount of increase in this example, first determine the current level of sales by multiplying the amount each customer spends by the number of customers ($10,000 X 250 = $2,500,000). Then, multiply current sales by the projected increase ($2,500,000 X 15% or .15 = $375,000).

"How does a business's gross profit compare to the industry standard of 30% if it has annual sales of $400,000 and cost of goods sold is $260,000?",35% higher,5% lower,35% lower,5% higher,D,"5% higher. Businesses often compare their income from sales and the cost of buying those goods to the industry standard to determine if they are spending too much based on the profit earned. If the industry standard is 30% gross profit, a business wants to make sure that it is earning that amount. In order to calculate the percent of gross profit, first subtract the cost of goods sold from annual sales to determine gross profit ($400,000 - $260,000 = $140,000). Then, divide that figure by annual sales ($140,000 / $400,000 = .35). Convert that figure to a percentage by multiplying by 100 (.35 X 100 = 35%). In this case, the business is earning 35% gross profit which is 5% higher than the industry standard. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossprofit.asp",Strategic Management,10,easy
