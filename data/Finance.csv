One strategy for helping to make this judgement is to collect references. Also, as is the case with individuals, companies have credit scores which indicate their level of creditworthiness. Finally, financial ratios can give some insight into whether the company's finances are strong enough that it will be in a position to pay its debts.

These descriptions of possible futures, however, cannot themselves arrive at a recommended decision. Since data analytics in business are often utilized to aid in decision-making, predictive analytics have limits in their applicability to decision-making. Where predictive analytics offer a forecast for the future, they do not recommend a specific course of action. Instead, predictive analytics can be combined with a rule or set of constraints to become prescriptive analytics, which take predictive analytics a step further by providing the rule and set of constraints. In this way, they limit the number of â€œpossible futuresâ€ down to those that are most likely to result in the preferred outcomes.

Fixed overhead costs are expenses that do not change in relation to changes in sales volume and include things such as rent and employee salaries.

Convergence within the finance industry typically involves financial providers from different financial sectors merging, such as a retail bank merging with an insurance company. Consolidation takes place when financial providers within the same institutional category merge, such as a retail bank merging with another retail bank. Some of the factors leading to convergence and consolidation in the finance industry are technology, liquidity constraints, a desire for increased profitability, and a desire for lower costs. Technological advancements have reduced the costs of offering new and different financial products. The convergence/consolidation of multiple financial companies usually results in more liquid capital to invest or to offer as loans for all companies involved. By merging, some financial firms (especially those converging with others within their financial sector) can achieve economies of scale, which result in reduced redundancy and lower costs for all involved.

What type of variance analysis involves determining the difference between the standard costs and the actual costs of raw materials used for production?,Fixed overhead,Selling price,Material yield,Purchase price,D,"Purchase price. A variance is the difference between an established standard and the actual outcome. It is important for a business to monitor variances in the price of raw materials because they affect its bottom line. When a vendor increases the prices that it charges for raw materials, it costs the business (manufacturer) more money to produce an item. The business may need to find a vendor that charges less for the materials or parts, or it may need to increase its selling priceâ€”the amount that the business charges its customers for the finished good. Fixed overhead costs are expenses that do not change in relation to changes in sales volume and include things such as rent and employee salaries.

Insurance institutions are different from banks because insurance institutions,ensure their customers against certain risks.,are subject to federal and state oversight.,act as an intermediary between savers and investors.,have a mismatch between their liabilities and assets.,A,"Ensure their customers against certain risks. An insurance institution is a financial intermediary that ensures its customers against certain risks, such as car accidents, house fires, broken items, etc. Customers pay regular insurance premiums in return for this insurance. Banks are subject to federal and state oversight, while insurance companies are subject only to state-level regulation. The bank acts as a financial intermediary between savers and investors, as banks take deposits, pay interest for their use, and lend out money to borrowers who typically pay for it at a high interest rate. In addition, banks accept short-term deposits and make long-term loans, meaning there is a mismatch between their liabilities and assets. With insurance institutions, liabilities are based on certain events happening.

Which of the following is an example of what happens during the contraction stage of the business cycle:,Production and prices reach their limit.,Companies steadily grow their production and profits.,GDP declines for two consecutive quarters.,Recession bottoms out and the business cycle restarts.,C,"GDP declines for two consecutive quarters. The four stages of the business cycle are expansion, peak, contraction (or recession), and trough. A contraction is the length of time between a peak and a trough, when economic activity is on the way down. During this time, unemployment numbers are high, the market experiences prolonged price declines, and gross domestic product (GDP) is below 2% or declines for two straight quarters. This leads to a trough, which is when the recession phase bottoms out and restarts the business cycle. A trough rebounds into the expansion phase, which is the length of time between a trough and a peak. During expansion, companies are steadily growing their production and profits, unemployment is low, and the stock market is performing well. This leads to a peak, which occurs when production and prices have reached their limit. This is often when companies are expanding recklessly, prices are becoming too high, and investors are overconfident. With no more room left for growth, a peak leads to a recession period. economy, and understanding them can lead to better financial decisions.

Because workers lose their income when they become unemployed, unemployed workers also lose their purchasing power. This can lead to unemployment for other workers, which affects the overall economy. For example, if someone is unemployed, they have less money to spend on goods and services, which could in turn harm companies that rely on that money to run their businesses, produce said goods and services, and pay their employees. Because of this, high unemployment rates affect both the unemployed and employed, and it does impact the production of goods and services. Unemployment can hurt the mental state of those who are employed. When companies are looking to cut costs, they may reduce their workforce, which can lead to workers who are still employed being forced to do more work and likely not receive additional compensation for their increased role and extra hours. Employed workers may also become nervous that they may lose their jobs.

Next, raise this sum to the fifth power, which is the same as multiplying the sum by itself five times (1.065 = 1.06 X 1.06 X 1.06 X 1.06 X 1.06 = 1.3382). Finally, multiply this product by the original amount of the first investment to find its future value ($5,000 X 1.3382 = $6,691). Next, repeat the process for the second investment. Its future value is equal to $15,000 X (1 + 0.09)5. First, add one to the interest rate (1+ 0.09 = 1.09). Then, raise this sum to the fifth power, which is the same as multiplying the sum by itself five times (1.095 = 1.09 X 1.09 X 1.09 X 1.09 X 1.09 = 1.5386).
