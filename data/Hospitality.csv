Sometimes, frustrated customers want to complain and release anger. Allowing them to express their feelings might help them calm down and make a resolution more likely.

Self-esteem is how you feel about yourself at any given time. Your level of self-esteem can fluctuate from time to time; however, if you have an overall high level of self-esteem, you can accept yourself as you areâ€”both your positive and negative qualities. Having good self-esteem does not mean that you overlook your faults, weaknesses and mistakes; rather, you recognize them and strive to improve over time. A person with high self-esteem has the ability to recognize others' abilities and accomplishments without feeling threatened or discouraged about their own abilities and accomplishments. Many people who have low self-esteem do not trust their own abilities and are less likely to try harder or strive for success because they fear they will fail. support/types-of-mental-health-problems/self-esteem/about-self-esteem/",Emotional Intelligence,3,easy

The development of rail, automobile, and air travel in the past 150 years has had the most impact on the development of the hospitality industry.

However, monitoring one's own nonverbal cues does not necessarily mean that the listener takes control of the conversation.

The tires you make aren't much different than the tires your clients could get from any other company, and the prices are similar, too. That's when customer service becomes key. Are you available when your clients need you? Are you willing to help them when they need to change orders? Can you help your customers if there's a problem with their shipments?

Many restaurants offer special prices on certain types of dinners to attract customers. Customers order those dinners because they are priced lower than usual. If customers also have coupons for discounts, the restaurant calculates the discount to determine the total cost. In this example, the restaurant is offering lobster dinners for $22.99. A table of four orders the dinners, but two of the customers have coupons for discounts. To process the coupons, the restaurant subtracts the discount amount from the cost of the two dinners. To determine the amount of discount, add the cost of the two dinners and calculate the 15% discount ($22.99 X 2 = $45.98; $45.98 X 15% or .15 = $6.897 or $6.90). Then, subtract the discount from the cost of the two dinners ($45.98 - $6.90 = $39.08). Add the discounted price of the two dinners to the regular price of the other two dinners to calculate the total cost for the table ($39.08 + $22.99 + $22.99 = $85.06). https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/discount",Selling,10,easy
