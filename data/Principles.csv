Increasing contract terms is also not a direct result of ethical behavior. It is only ethical to ask for more funding if the project itself requires the additional funds.

What is one benefit that the internet provides consumers?,Reduces information overload,Provides a way to promote products,Makes it easier to comparison shop,Lessens the need for intermediaries,C,"Makes it easier to comparison shop. The continuing growth of the internet (e-commerce) allows consumers to log onto their computers and visit several websites to compare products and prices. This makes comparison shopping easier because consumers do not need to call or drive to multiple businesses to obtain the desired product information. The internet benefits businesses because it allows them to promote their products on their websites. Another way that the internet affects businesses is that it often reduces the need to use intermediaries to get the products to the end users. Because there is so much information available through the internet, people may suffer from information overload, which is a disadvantage of the internet. 2022, from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-internet/ BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION CORE EXAMâ€”KEY 17",Information Management,8,easy

After Julio listened attentively to the customer's complaints and thanked the customer for bringing the problem to his attention, he should restate the complaint in his own words to show an understanding. This is the third step in the general steps employees can take to handle customer complaints appropriately. By doing this, Julio will demonstrate to the customer that he was listening and is taking their concerns seriously. Generally, Julio's next step would be to promptly investigate the problem by either talking with his manager or checking the company policy. When customers express complaints, employees should be able to follow a procedure that lines up with company policies. After explaining the concert venue's policy to the customer, Julio's final step will be to explain the plan of action to the customer and take that action.
